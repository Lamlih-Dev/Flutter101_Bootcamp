# OOP Calculator App Using Dart
Yesterday we attended our second session in Flutter 101 Bootcamp organized by GDG Guelmim, in this session we learned about the OOP programming paradigm which we discovered classes (properties, methods, constructors) and how to instantiate an object, then we learned about inheritance where we covered the extends, super, and this keywords, and we covered how to override a method, finally we learned about asynchronous where we learned about async/await keywords. It was a session rich of informations I realy enjoyed it ! At the end of this session we had a task to do which is refactor the calculator from the previous task which perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, then implement the OOP approche while developing it.
And here are some screenshots of the app that I created:
