# Calculator App Using Dart
Yesterday we attended our first session in Flutter 101 Bootcamp organized by GDG Guelmim, in this session we learned the basics of Dart such as data types, conditions, loops, nullability and more ! It was fun and full of informations, and at the end of this session we had a task to do which is creating a calculator which perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application will display the results of the calculations in the console.
And here are some screenshots of the app that I created:
