# E-COMMERCE App Using Dart & Flutter [SESSION DATE : 23/01/2023]
Yesterday we attended our fifth session in Flutter 101 Bootcamp organized by GDG Guelmim, in this session we learned about styles and how to style our widgets, especially how to style texts, buttons, containers and more, we learned the difference between margin and padding and how to use them and how they affect our design! The instructor used a really good approach to teach us how to find and use the adequate styling param for each widget we want to style. At the end of this session we had a task to do which is re-make the sign in, sign up, and on boarding screens that we created the last session using a little bit of styling and bring life to them!<br>
Finally our screens looks much better:
