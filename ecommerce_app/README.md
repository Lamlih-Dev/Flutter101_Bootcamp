# E-COMMERCE App Using Dart & Flutter [SESSION DATE : 25/01/2023]
Yesterday we attended our sixth session in Flutter 101 Bootcamp organized by GDG Guelmim, in this session we continued our journey with the styles and how to style our widgets, todays was about how to add fonts, icons, and images(local and online hosted images), we learned how to use hexadecimal colors too. At the end of this session we had a task to do which is adding the icons, illustrations, and fonts to improve the sign in, sign up, and on boarding screens that we created the last session !<br>
Finally our screens looks much better:
