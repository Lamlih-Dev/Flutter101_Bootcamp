# E-COMMERCE App Using Dart & Flutter
Yesterday we attended our fourth session in Flutter 101 Bootcamp organized by GDG Guelmim, in this session we learned about widgets and widgets tree, we learned about Statefull and Stateless widgets and the difference between them and when to use each one! we took a look on some famous widgets such us Text, Column, Row, Stack, Container, and more. At the end of this session we had a task to do which is creating a sign in, sign up, and on boarding screens using flutter and dart of course !<br>
I know they look super ugly ðŸ¤£ but here are some screenshots of the app that I created (All those screens will improve while we progress on the bootcamp):
